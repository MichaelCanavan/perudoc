			<p>Best dialogue - I really can't emphasis how transformative the six weeks were. A few months ago all I knew about Peru was Lima and there might be llamas there but now it sticks out on the map as I place I feel I have an intimate understanding with. Probably the best South American country to visit - deserts and rainforests, really intelligible Spanish, outstanding food, growing economy, and the most genuinely friendly people. Monica is unequivocally the most hard working, dedicated leader we could have asked for and I'm grateful she pushed us to fully maximize our experience. Without doubt an outstanding highlight, and probably most instructive semester, of my time at Northeastern - if you're interested in having the time of your life, mark May 15th on your calendar, simple as that.</p>

		    <p>This dialogue was a trip of a life time and suitable to all levels of Spanish. The people were very welcoming and excursions were breath taking. I recommend this dialogue to everyone!</p>

			<p>To anyone interested in this Dialogue, feel free to message me with any questions/concerns! It was an great trip, with amazing people, an amazing professor (guapa, inteligente, fantastica), and most surprisingly, amazing food! (But really. While you are there send me back some food.)</p>

			<p>This dialogue was UNREAL! It was such a great learning experience that I'm extremely glad I was able to be a part of. While you learn a whole bunch through your classes and museum/ruins visits, you learn even more with the freedom you're given to explore Miraflores, Ica, Cusco, and so many more areas. I was truly immersed in the beautiful Peruvian culture everywhere we went and returned home speaking fluent Spanish and cooking delicious lomo saltado. You get the chance to hang out with local children, college kids, and host families in schools, homes, and clubs as part of your curriculum! I can honestly say it was the best 5 weeks of my life and I have so much to show for it (broken language barriers, amazing pictures of hiking Machu Picchu and sand boarding down Haucachina, and long-lasting friendships).</p>

			<h3>Stephanie DiLucia</h3>
			<p>I can honestly say that this Dialogue has been one of the greatest experiences of my life thus far. It's truly an incredible country that has so much to offer! From sand boarding in the desert to visiting one of the Wonders of the World, there's always some sort of adventure awaiting you. Every step along the way, you'll be able to see an improvement in your Spanish (trust me, this is probably one of the best feelings!) and start to feel more and more comfortable in the place that you'll quickly learn to call your second home. This trip is an incredible experience, and I encourage everyone to really consider it! If anyone has any questions about what the trip might be like, feel free to contact me!</p>
